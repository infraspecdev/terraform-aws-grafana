# iam-role

This sub-module creates an IAM role and attaches appropriate IAM policies to the IAM role.

## Presets

### IAM Role

- The `name` is marked as a required variable, which sets the name of the IAM role.

## Notes

- The IAM policies defined under `iam_policies` are created and automatically attached to the IAM role.
- The ARNs of the IAM policies specified under the `iam_policy_attachments` are automatically attached to the IAM role. This is useful in cases where you are referencing:
  - Amazon-managed IAM Policies, or
  - Self-managed IAM Policies
