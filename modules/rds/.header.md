# rds

This sub-module creates:
- RDS instance
- DB Subnet Group, and
- DB Parameter Group

## Presets

### DB Instance

- The `storage_type` is set to "gp2" (General Purpose SSD) as the default choice (instead of "io1", which requires Iops), and can be overridden to use any other Storage type.
- The `db_name` is set to "default_db" as the default database name, and can be overridden.
- The `username` is set to "admin_user" as the default master user's username, and can be overridden.
- The `skip_final_snapshot` is set to `true` as the default choice (which skips the creation of DB snapshots when the RDS instance is destroyed), and can be overridden to be `false`.

## Notes

- The `family` attribute under DB Parameter Group is marked as required.
